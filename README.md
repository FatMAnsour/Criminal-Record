# Criminal-Record

A Criminal record system is used to store and show a person's criminal history. 
People who can access the system are Admins. We keep track of each adminâ€™s ID, name, password. And, each time an admin wants to log into the system, they have to provide these three fields in order to record or access information on the system.
